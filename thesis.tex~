%% this is a general purpose outline for preparing your thesis.  

%% as you can probably guess, in latex the ``%'' sign starts a comment, for some
%% reason i got in the habit of using two for main comments like this and have
%% done so ever since.  the comment goes to the end of the line.

%% to build this you will have to install the standard latex packages (if you
%% want to use the machine in my office that works.  the basic build command
%% sequence is (assuming the main latex file is titled ``thesis.tex''):

%% pdflatex thesis
%% bibtex thesis
%% pdflatex thesis
%% pdflatex thesis

%% you do not actually need to do all four every time, but whenever you change
%% the citations/references file, you will have to go through the complete
%% sequence to have all labels resolve (basically latex is a one-pass system
%% that uses files to record references for use in later passes.

%% the way i have set this up, you will create your main prose in this file (thesis.tex),
%% your references will go in the bibtex file (refs.bib, i have set yours up with my
%% version for the parallel simulation literature) and your figures should be stored as
%% pdf in the figs subdirectory.  there are online tutorials and books available to help
%% you (i would stick to the online stuff).  i can also help you resolve some things.  i

%% SOME COMMENTS ON THESIS WRITING

%% as you write your thesis, remember that this is a formal document; it is also a story
%% and it should be interesting, but it should *not* be informal.  the prose should be in
%% 3rd person (no ``I'' or ``we'').  contemporary writing tends to violate this pretty
%% regularily and most papers are written in second person instead of third person;
%% however a good habit is to avoid self references and stick to third person.  each
%% paragraph should stay in the same tense (prefereably present tense), and USE ACTIVE
%% VOICE.

%% also, try to remember that you are delivering a story that should lead the reader
%% through your thesis topic; you will need to constantly remind the reader where they
%% are, each chapter (after the first) should have an intro/transition paragraph
%% describing what the chapter is all about.  also, remember your writing fundamentals,
%% that stuff about topic sentences and transitions is true; the first sentence of each
%% paragraph sets the tone/topic for that paragraph; as you end the paragraph, it should
%% be transitioning the reader to the next paragraph (sometimes explicitly, sometimes
%% implicitly).  while this sounds difficult, it should really just flow; if you build
%% your thesis like a story, the prose generally just falls out....

%% permit me to restate this fact (it *is* that important):

%% each paragraph should have a topic sentence, it must focus on one topic and you may
%% need to have transitions between the paragraphs to help the reader make the transition
%% through your discussion.  generally you do not really have to do much to support
%% transistions (that it if you are thinking/writing like it is a story and you remember
%% that each sentence and paragraph should build and continue the story).  develop your
%% paragraph structure to present a coherent thought from the topic sentence to the final
%% sentence (of the paragraph).  most of the time this will naturally lead you to the
%% subsequent paragraph.  so in the end, it *is* a story that is easy to read.

%% vocabulary, vocabulary, vocabulary; think specifically about the words you use and the
%% consistency of your writing.  for example, these words/phrases mean different things:
%% 'between' or 'among'; 'complex' or 'complicated'; 'like' or 'such as'.  in general you
%% will not need a dictionary or thesaurus, you already know the words, they are just not
%% part of your working vocabulary; slow down, think about the words you are using.
%% sometimes you will need to look up a word definition, do not hesitate to pickup a
%% dictionary (especially a the beginning of your writing experience).

%% restating:

%% no contractions, ever!!  write formally, no ``something gets'' instead write
%% ``something obtains'', think about your wording.  do not start a paragraph with
%% ``Additionally,'', use ``In addition,''.  use exactly the word you want at each place
%% in the prose; think about the subtle different definitions similar words, ``between''
%% and ``among'' have drastically different meanings; so do ``complex'' and
%% ``complicated''.  be sure you understand the differences.  at first, you may need to
%% leverage a carful use of the dictionary (online or on paper) as you write this thesis,
%% you will be surprised at how much you really do not know about a word's specific
%% definition (you would be surprised to know how much i still use a dictionary).
%% finally, think about your words, expand your writing vocabulary.  it can be really
%% rewarding to write very good prose (and your mechanics of writing are already solid).
%% what makes good writing superior is the vocabulary and consistency.

%% consistency, consistency, consistency: do not use multiple terms for the same thing.
%% clearly define your terminology and then use it consistently.  also, introduce the
%% terms and structure of your discussions in a logical manner.  this is probably the
%% worst violation that new writers make, they are inconsistent, unorderly, and
%% incomplete....which leads me to:

%% be consistent!!  THIS IS HUGELY IMPORTANT.  when you name something use the
%% same naming throughout; do not call something a subsystem in one chapter and
%% a subassembly in another.  select a name for your thing (e.g., signing
%% device, simulation object, etc) and stick with it throughout.  there is
%% nothing more confusing and offputting than to have the writer use multiple
%% phrases to refer to the same thing.  consistency is critical.  i could go on
%% and on, but let us stop here for now.

%% provide details.  the reader cannot (and does not) know what you do not tell them.  you
%% must provide full and detailed explainations on everything.  what motivates your work,
%% what constraints, assumptions, and other factors influence your work and your
%% decisions.  you are trying to convince the reader that your work has merit and is worth
%% understanding, the only way to achieve that is to provide them with enough information
%% that they understand the context and specifics of your work. throughout the writing
%% process, think about and try to think about your audience.  try to read the prose from
%% their perspective, especially try to invision someone who is technically trained, but
%% who is without your detailed understanding of your topic.  while the thesis should be
%% readable to someone like me who (probably) has a detailed understanding of your topic,
%% it should also be readable to most of the graduate students and faculty in computer
%% engineering or computer science.  THINK ABOUT AND WRITE TO YOUR AUDIENCE!!

%% also, you will have to repeat yourself much more than you are confortable with.  your
%% writing has to carry the reader, you literally have to lead them through your chapters.
%% you *will* end up restating things that you think are obvious.  each chapter will have
%% to begin with an intro to remind the reader where you are going to take them (they will
%% forget).  it is not obvious to them, you have to explain.  remember, however, that it
%% is a story, it is a technical story, but none-the-less, you are developing an idea and
%% you want potential readers to pay attention to your prose.  make it a story that flows.

%% finally, if at all possible, write from front to back, abstract, intro, to conclusions
%% and future research.  the reason for this is that it simplifies your work to develop a
%% consistent and complete story.  merely jamming together a set of separately developed
%% sections/chapters does not generally work out very well.  this is not always easy for
%% an inexperienced writer to do, but it will ultimately make your life easier; perhaps it
%% will not be possible with your thesis, but ultimately, if you spend much time writing
%% in your life, you will some day see the wisdom in this.

%% some more general comments:

%% 1. citations should have a preceeding space space use ``citation \cite{foo}'' instead
%%    of ``citation\cite{foo}''.

%% 2. if you have a figure/table in the document, it must be discussed in the prose and
%%    you cannot simply say ``see \ref{pseudocode}''; you must use the object name, such
%%    as ``see Figure \ref{pseudocode}'' (also capitalize the object name).

%% lastly, try to enjoy this experience.  it is the culmination of a great deal of effort
%% on your part to develop a better understanding of some part of our world.  the
%% dissemination of your newfound knowledge is the final step in any knowledge discovery
%% activity.  you will want to have a thesis that you can be proud of your entire life.
%% it takes time to develop a decent, well written thesis.  please take the time necessary
%% to try to achieve that goal.  it will be worth it.

\chapter*{Abstract} 

%% the abstract covers your thesis soup to nuts.  the abstract may be published
%% separately from the main body so it needs to be fully contained and say
%% something about nearly everything in your thesis.  basically in 1-2 pages you
%% need to: bring the reader into your topic, explain why it is important and
%% why existing solutions are insufficient, it must describe your approach to a
%% solution and what your primary results are.  whew!!

\chapter*{Acknowledgments} 

%% put your acknowledgements here.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro} 

%% the introduction should bring people into your topic space; it should explain the
%% problem, give a brief statement of existing solutions and their problems to motivate
%% your work.  it should then give a brief summary of your work that leads the dicussion
%% to the presentation of your hypothesis.  finally, you should wrapup the chapter with a
%% thesis overview section.

%% do not confuse the topic of your thesis with the particular piece of work that you did
%% for your thesis.  generally your topic is the broader perspective into which your
%% thesis work makes a contribution.  be sure you understand what your thesis is all about
%% and why what you have done is important.  in the introduction you are giving the reader
%% enough information so that they understand what you are talking about, why it is
%% important, what evidence lead you to initially develop your hypothesis, and a quick
%% overview of the study plan that you followed to attempt to confirm or refute your
%% hypothesis.

%% in the introduction, your general organization should be organized as follows:

%% 1. bring your audience into your topic.  i like to think of these first few paragraphs
%%    as a funnel to focus the reader into the thesis topic.  you have to direct the
%%    reader into the subject of your thesis quickly and in a way that captures their
%%    interest.

%%    in this first part you should not describe your solution, you should only describe
%%    the problem.  you should be able to do this in 2-3 paragraphs.

%% 2. briefly tell your audience what the current approachs are to solve this problem and
%%    (also briefly) what the key advantages/disadvantages arise with each solution.  by
%%    the end of this discussion, the reader should have a clear understand of what you
%%    are talking about and a general idea as to why it remains a problem to study
%%    (basically you are introducing and motivating the next paragraphs where you describe
%%    your work.  (this should take 1-3 paragraphs).

%% 3. what is your solution; first give the high level overview description of your work.
%%    you should briefly (and yet fully) describe the key points of your solution, the
%%    various options and opportunities that it provies, and finally its
%%    strengths/weaknesses.  again, you do not need to give specific details on the actual
%%    work.  (this part should probably take 2-5 paragraphs).

%% below i provide a very brief tutorial example on the use of latex.

%% -------------------------beginning of latex tutorial-----------------------------------------------

%% HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES ON THE USE OF LATEX

%% The beauty of latex is that once you get the template in place, writing the
%% paragraphs of your thesis is a simple matter of just typing out the ascii text
%% for each paragraph with an empty line separator between paragraphs.  Like this.

%% One or more empty lines; it does not matter to latex, it will treat them as one.
%% That said, you should not leave a blank character at the beginning of a line as
%% that will also cause a paragraph break (i think).  Now to give \emph{emphasis}
%% to some with \emph{italics}, you just use the \emph{emph} command.  Here is how
%% you make something look like it was written by a \texttt{typewritter}.
%% \textbf{Bold} is not terribly difficult, nor is \underline{underline}.  You can
%% even change the \textsf{font}, \textsc{Font}, or \textsl{font}.  However, most
%% of the time you will simply be using \emph{emphasis}, \texttt{typewritter}, and
%% sometimes \textbf{bold} commands.

%% While Latex is a complex typesetting language with many options, most of your
%% thesis will boil down to %% LOOK, comments can go most everywhere using only a
%% few commands.  We've already seen the important font commands, whenever you want
%% to make a citation to one of your bibliographic entries you will simply use a
%% texttt{cite} command \cite{fujimoto-90}.  This will automatically add the
%% reference to your reference list and insert the proper reference number/name
%% within the prose (the formatting and pulling from the \texttt{refs.bib} file is
%% achieved using the \texttt{bibtex} program).  Pretty nice.

%% Sooner or later you will want to make an itemized list, enumerated list, or
%% description list.  These are done:

%% \begin{itemize}

%%   \item This is an itemized list.
%%   \item Simply start each new item with the \texttt{item} command.  Each item can
%%     be a paragraph of prose that latex will automatically format for you.
%%   \item Punctuate your lists and equations as if they were part of the prose
%%     (they are).

%% \end{itemize}

%% \noindent
%% When you have a list in the middle of a paragraph, the trailing paragraph should
%% not be indented.  You can tell latex to not indent the paragraph with the
%% \texttt{noindent} command.  Now let us look at an enumeration list:

%% \begin{enumerate}

%%   \item first enumeration,
%%   \item second enumeration, and
%%   \item third enumeration.

%% \end{enumerate}

%% \noindent
%% Notice the punctuation flows from the paragraph through the list.  And finally
%% if you would like a description list you should type:

%% \begin{description}

%%   \item[first] A description of something.
%%   \item[second:] Basically the brackets to the \texttt{item} command in a
%%     description list cause the text to head the list item.  I am not sure what
%%     happens if you try to use it in an enumeration or itemized list.

%% \end{description}

%% So really latex is a programming language for text formatting.  Sometimes you
%% will want to have a segment of ascii text and have latex leave it alone.  This
%% you can achieve using the verbatim environment:

%% \begin{verbatim}

%% which basically tells latex to typeset the 
%%     text using a typewritter font
%% using the
%%  spacing and % stuff just as it is typed.  note that the comment character 
%% did not trigger a comment.  much of latex is turned off in a latex
%% verbatim environment.



%% even blank lines are preserved.

%% \end{verbatim}

%% Now there are special characters that can cause you problems; fortunately they
%% are usually escaped with a backslash character.  For example we can place a \%
%% character in the prose by escaping it.  

%% You may have heard that latex has a really nice math formatting environment.  It
%% does, although you will probably not really need its full complexity.  There is
%% both a major and minor way to enter math mode; for the most part you will simply
%% use the \$ symbol to enter it.  Like this: $2^3 + \alpha_i$.  If you do much
%% math in your thesis, this is likely to cause you the most difficulty (although
%% formatting tables can be a challenge until you get it done).

%% Now we come to figures.  Latex will float them around on you (controlling the
%% float can be one of the most frustrating things about latex).  For the most part
%% you should simply ignore the float and insert the commands to bring in the
%% figure either immediately before of sometime after the paragraph where you first
%% discuss it.  So we now should discuss Figure \ref{exFig}.

%% \begin{figure}
%%   \centering \includegraphics[width=6in]{figs/placeHolder}
%%   \caption{Example Figure}\label{exFig}
%% \end{figure}

%% OK so that is it for my simple example tutorial.  Not much, but hopefully enough
%% to get you started.  

%% ----------------------------end of latex tutorial--------------------------------------------

%% this is where you should begin your intro


\section{Motivation and Plan of Study}

%% present the motivation behind your work.  you should probably also provide a quick
%% synopsys of the plan of study/work.

\section{Thesis Overview}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:

%% technically each of these should be a 2-3 sentence paragraph giving the
%% reader a general understanding of what will be in each chapter.  you
%% must remember that the reader does not know what you know and they will
%% need some repitition to remember where you are taking them.  
Chapter \ref{background} contains some background information on parallel simulation and
parallel computing that is used in this thesis.

Chapter \ref{relatedWork} reviews several of the prominent parallel simulation kernels
that use the Time Warp synchronization protocol.  The software architecture and target
compute platforms for each is described.

%% all other chapters go here....

Finally, Chapter \ref{conclude} contains some concluding remarks and suggestions for
future research.


\chapter{Background}\label{background}

%% in this chapter you are providing any background information that would be
%% needed by the reader to facilitate their comprehension of your thesis topic.
%% basically you need to provide knowledge that your intended audience may not
%% have.  in this case, your indended audience should be young researchers and
%% experienced researchers (yea it can be tough).  you should plan your writing
%% to target that the lowest academic level of your readership.  in particular
%% you writing should target graduate students approaching their second year of
%% graduate study.  also, you are not necessarily writing to all possible
%% graduate students; you can target the particular class of researchers that
%% would normally read something in this topic space.  remember you are
%% providing background to facilitate understanding; you do not need to explain
%% everything about each topic, just enough that they can develop a reasonably
%% clear understanding that will allow them to read and comprehend the research
%% project that your thesis encapsulates.

%% start with an introductory paragraph explaining what this chapter
%% contains.  answer the question: what background are you going to cover?

%% DOUG: the key background in this chapter is:
%%    (i) a general description of parallel and distributed simulation and specifically
%%        the time warp protocol.  do not be afraid to create graphics to illustrate the
%%        main points of your discussion
%%    (ii) a very brief discussion of parallel computing hardware with a focus on the
%%         standard x86-based SMP platforms and clusters as well as the big.LITTLE ARM
%%         platform and the heterogeneous nature of the platform.  you should illustrate
%%         the general processor/memory structure of these solutions including the cache
%%         structures. 

This chapter describes the basics of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) as well as ...

\section{Discrete Event Simulation}

Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a method of modeling the execution of a physical system with a
sequence of events that occur at discrete time intervals. A Discrete Event Simulation typically
contains three main data structures

\begin{description}

  \item[State variables: ] A set of variables that describe the current state of the system.
  \item[Simulation Clock: ] A clock to measure the progress of the simulation and determine the order of event processing.
  \item[Pending Event Set: ] A set of future events that are waiting to be procesed.

\end{description}

\noindent
A \emph{Simulation Model} describes a physical system by a set of \emph{Logical Processes} (LP's).
Each LP corresponds to a physical process that is part of the physical system. The LP's interact
with timestamped events that dictate the simulation time that the event should be processed.
With each event that occurs, and only when an event occurs, the state of the system is updated.

In a \emph{Sequential} Discrete Event Simulation only one event is processed at a time. All pending
events are kept in a single list which is sorted by timestamp. The next event to be processed is
always the one with lowest timestamp. Each successive event updates the state of the system,
advances the simulation clock, and possibly produces new future events. This is clearly not very
efficient for large simulations. This method can be improved by realizing that events for
different LP's are indepedant and will only affect the state for a single LP.

\section{Parallel Discrete Event Simulation}

\emph{Parallel} Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) is a method running a discrete event simulation
on a parallel computer which could be a shared-memory multiprocessor, a distributed-memory system
such as cluster or NUMA system, or a combination of both. In a parallel discrete event simulation
the state of the system is usually split among the logical processes so that each one
contains a portion of system's state without any sharing of state variables\cite{fujimoto-90}.
In addition to each logical process having it's own separate state, the logical processes also
have seperate simulation clocks and pending event sets. Event's from different LP's can then be processed
concurrently without the need to worry about sharing state variables and the model can be viewed
as concurrent processes operating independantly which contribute to the overall progression of the
simulation. This has the potential to increase performance significantly; However, it is possible
that events at a receiving LP can be processed out of order, violating causality. These \emph{causality
errors} can occur because of the independant nature of the logical processes. The sending LP's have
no knowledge of the events that are being sent or received at other LP's. Causality errors can
produce incorrect changes in state variables and incorrect events to be sent to other LP's.

Parallel Discrete Event Simulation techniques can be categorized in terms of how causality errors
are handled. \emph{Conservative} approaches use methods to detect when possible causality errors
might occur and prevent them from ever occuring. \emph{Optimistic} approaches allow causality errors
to occur but use methods to detect and recover from the errors. For the remainder of this thesis, only
optimistic methods will be discussed, specifically the Time Warp mechanism which is the most widely used
optimistic mechanism used in practice.

\subsection{Virtual Time and The Time Warp Mechanism}

The Time Warp mechanism is an optimistic method of simulation which is based on the virtual time
paradigm\cite{jefferson-85}. \emph{Virtual Time} provides a method of ordering events in distributed
systems which are not described by real time. When used for parallel discrete event simulation,
Virtual Time is synonymous with simulation time. The current time of an LP's simulation clock in
Time Warp is called the \emph{Local Virtual Time} (LVT).

Jefferson describes the Time Warp mechanism in terms of three main data structures:

\begin{description}

    \item[Input Queue: ]
    \item[Output Queue: ]
    \item[State Queue: ]

\chapter{Related Work}\label{relatedWork}

%% introductory paragraph, what does this chapter cover?  what are the
%% various categories of related work that you are going to cover?  why are the
%% topics of importance?  you must give the reader a reason to slog through this
%% unfamiliar stuff, they are here reading so they have some interest, you just
%% have to be careful to help them understand what AND WHY they are reading this
%% stuff. 

%% this chapter explains what has been done and what the strengths/weaknesses of
%% these previous works are.  basically you are showing the reader that you
%% understand what has been done and you are explaining to them why, despite the
%% previous work, your thesis study needs to be done.

%% DOUG: this chapter should focus on the main time warp kernels out there.  GTW, ROSS,
%% CTW (clustered time warp), and WARPED (be clear that it is the predecessor to
%% warped2).  are there others that we should consider, yes, but probably only in
%% passing.

\section{Other Time Warp Simulators}

\subsection{Georgia Tech Time Warp (GTW)}

Georgia Tech Time Warp is a well-known Time Warp Simulator which was designed specifically for
shared-memory multiprocessors. Each LP is mapped to a specific processor by the simulation model
during initialization. The LP to processor is static throughout the entire simulation.

\chapter{Summary of Results}\label{resultsSummary}

%% DOUG: wrap up the results, review the main configurations that make sense to the best
%% general performance that one could expect to use.  depending on your principle results,
%% this may have to be broken down into two main parts, one for x86 and one for ARM.

\chapter[Conclusions \& Future Research]{Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research}\label{conclude}

%% in general this should be one of the most difficult chapters to write.
%% unfortunately authors (even established researchers) seldom give this chapter
%% adequate time or thought.  technically this chapter provides conclusions and
%% suggestions for future research.  the future research is often an
%% afterthought of lightly considered suggestions.  in actual fact, these two
%% components (conclusions and future research suggestions) are tightly coupled
%% and could really say something.  let me explain.

%% A CONCLUSION IS NOT A SUMMARY OF YOUR RESULTS.  almost all
%% papers/theses/dissertations contain a summary that is not really a
%% conclusion.  while that is ok, it leaves much to be desired.  by pursuing a
%% research investigation, you should have studied the problem hard enough to
%% have actually derived some real insights/lessons from the work that was
%% performed.  ask yourself, what do i now know that i did not before?  do you
%% believe that the idea remains sound?  what have you learned (and not just the
%% performance results), but especially what do you know (or believe to be true)
%% now that the work is done and you reexamine the problem in light of your
%% additional experience.  are there avenues of work or alternate solutions that
%% you would pursue instead?  why?  what things are clear to you now that were
%% not when you began the investigation (or that others may not fully understand
%% just from reading the details of your investigation).  these insights should
%% also help you to structure a set of future research suggestions.  these
%% suggestions should not simply be laid out there to be explored, but your
%% prose should explain why they would be important/interesting pursuits.

%% this chapter can be hard to get right; most people do not bother.  a summary
%% conclusions chapter with half thought suggestions for future research is ok
%% and i will let you get by with one; but if you really want to look back with
%% satisfication and know that perhaps you spawned additional investigations to
%% continue your studies, spend some time here.  the world will be better off if
%% you do.

%% regards,
%% p. wilsey

%% introduction to the chapter contents....yes even for this chapter.  i've
%% included a couple of section headers for you to consider; often this chapter
%% only has the last (suggestions for future work) as a specific section break.

\section{Summary of Findings}

%% summarize your findings

\section{Detailed Conclusions}

%% if you actually sat down and figured out what you now know that you did not
%% previously.  congratulations!!  you are well above average.  now let us wow
%% your audience with your tremendous insights.

\section{Suggestions for Future Work}

%% since you took the time to really think about you work, you will almost
%% certainly have strong ideas about what should now be done to further the
%% project.  explain what should be explored.  as you present each suggestion,
%% give supporting arugments as to why it would be important to explore and, if
%% you have any preliminary arguments/perspectives about the suggestion,
%% describe those as well.  




%% if you plan to have appendicies uncomment the next two lines.  the \appendix
%% command will alter the \chapter command to format it as an appendix.  pretty
%% easy. 

%%\Appendix
%%\chapter{Appendix A}\label{appendixA}



%% these commands tell latex to put the references here.  for the most part you
%% should just leave this stuff alone.

\bibliography{refs}
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr} \markright{ }
